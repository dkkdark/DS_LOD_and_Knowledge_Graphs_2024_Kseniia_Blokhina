It is written by some of the members of the library learning support team, who deliver the programme. It describes the steps involved in the programme’s development and design, discusses the pedagogical principles that influenced the initiative, and summarises the evaluations we have undertaken to date. These evaluations have yielded positive informal and formal feedback from the students and lecturers who participated in the programme. The value of a pedagogically sound, active learning approach to information literacy training is highlighted throughout the results. By providing constructive solutions for incorporating active learning into library user education programmes, this paper is expected to be a useful source of practical information for libraries in similar positions, of similar scale, faced with similar challenges.

It can lead to complications, especially infection, dehydration and fatigue. Saliva can also collect at the back of the throat which causes coughing and may lead to a higher risk of aspiration. In addition, complications from sialorrhoea may cause psychological complications, such as embarrassment, social isolation and feelings of rejection. All these consequences of sialorrhoea can subsequently impact on quality of life. However, there is limited research available in relation to the optimal management of sialorrhoea and subsequently there is no consensus on best practice. Aim: Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate practices in the management of sialorrhoea in older adult residential care settings and to, consequently, make recommendations for sialorrhoea management so as to improve quality of life and enhance the person-centred care approach to sialorrhoea management Methods: The study adopted a two phase mixed methods design involving a cross-sectional, descriptive correlational survey and an exploratory, descriptive qualitative design. Sixteen older adult residential care settings in the South East region of Ireland were used as the study sites. A purposive sampling method was used to recruit participants in both study phases. The first phase of this study involved two concurrent strands, one strand involved a survey of older adults experiencing sialorrhoea to identify the impact of sialorrhoea regarding their care needs and their views on sialorrhoea management. The parallel strand involved focus group interviews with the multidisciplinary healthcare team involved with the care of older adults with sialorrhoea to explore and identify current sialorrhoea management practices. The second phase of this study involved one to one in-depth interviews with caregivers (nurses or healthcare assistants) in care of older adults to further explore and confirm findings from the first phase of this study, and to identify changes required to current care and management of sialorrhoea. Findings: Phase 1 questionnaire survey findings revealed that sialorrhoea has quite a significant impact on older adults’ quality of life, relationships were identified between quality of life and impact of sialorrhoea. However, both phase 1 and phase 2 findings also revealed a lack of awareness and knowledge of the underlying issues and management strategies for sialorrhoea in these older adults’ residential care settings. These findings indicate the need for more structured care provision complying with the person-centred care approach. Findings identified that first line healthcare professionals strive to provide care to older adults suffering from sialorrhoea with the utmost empathy and compassion. However, findings demonstrated that first line healthcare professionals face challenges due to a lack of guidelines and, training and education provision. Conclusion: An understructured care provision plan, and the lack of estalished coordination of care among the multidisciplinary healthcare members indicated a deficit in a person-centred care approach to sialorrhoea management within the Irish context. Therefore study findings recommend that current practices would benefit from a structured systematic care protocol regarding sialorrhoea, so as the person-centred care approach could be augmented by such protocols. These include systematic assessment of sialorrhoea, wider multidisciplinary engagement and networking, and continuous professional development training and education programmes focusing on non-invasive management techniques. In order to improve care for older adults with sialorrhoea in residential care setting, policy makers, stakeholders and researchers should work together to further develop national evidence based guidelines to direct the management of sialorrhoea, specifically to develop protocols for nurses to follow in everyday care of the older adults."],"publicationDate":"2020-06-01","source":[],"format":["text"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"dedup_wf_002::3ac6d2e5b9cafe9ae5f2bf05cb78112a","originalId":["oai:repository.wit.ie:3453"],"pid":[],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:22.178","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":2.3516435E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"opendoar____::50c1f44e426560f3f2cdcb3e19e39903","value":"Waterford Institute of Technology - Open Access Repository"},{"key":"opendoar____::4daa3db355ef2b0e64b472968cb70f0d","value":"SETU Open Access Repository"}],"instance":[{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Thesis","url":["http://repository.wit.ie/3453/"],"publicationDate":"2020-06-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::4daa3db355ef2b0e64b472968cb70f0d","value":"SETU Open Access Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::4daa3db355ef2b0e64b472968cb70f0d","value":"SETU Open Access Repository"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1111/jonm.13236"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Thesis","publicationDate":"2020-06-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::50c1f44e426560f3f2cdcb3e19e39903","value":"Waterford Institute of Technology - Open Access Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::50c1f44e426560f3f2cdcb3e19e39903","value":"Waterford Institute of Technology - Open Access Repository"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This study evaluates selected factors contributing to recent dairy farmer’s investment decisions and examines the relationship between the adoption of Fixed Milk Price Contracts as a risk management tool and farm investments. This research applies the two-stage residual inclusion approach to address this research question using Teagasc NFS data from 2016 to 2021. This approach is applied to control for potential endogeneity including risk aversion. The results point to the economic relevance of the FMC adoption towards farm investment decisions although the magnitude of the association is limited. Subsidies play an important role in the investment decision although they are a small proportion in the overall specialised dairy farm income and provide a relatively stable source of income in Ireland.

The objective of our research was to investigate the effect of ultrasound alone and in combination with the chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin (DOX) and temozolomide (TMZ) on human glioblastoma (GBM) and the human epidermoid carcinoma cancer 2D and 3D cell cultures. Results indicated that the US 96-probe device could induce tumour sphere cytotoxicity in a dosage- and time-dependent manner, with multiple treatments augmenting this cytotoxic effect. With enhanced cytotoxicity, US decreased tumour sphere growth metabolic activity, disrupted spheroid integrity, and heightened the occurrence of DNA double strand breaks, resulting in damage to tumour spheres and an inability to rebuild tumour spheres after multiple US treatments. The combination of US and TMZ / DOX enhanced the efficiency of treatment for GBM and epidermoid carcinoma by enhancing induced cytotoxicity in 3D tumour spheres compared to 2D monolayer cells, and also by increasing the incubation time, which is the most crucial way to differentiate between the effectiveness of drug treatment with and without US. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that US enhances drug diffusion, uptake, and cytotoxicity using 3D spheroid models when compared with 2D cultures. It also demonstrates the significance of 3D cell culture models in drug delivery and discovery research.</jats:p><jats:sec id=\"s1aaa\"><jats:title>Graphical Abstract</jats:title><jats:fig id=\"ufig1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" fig-type=\"figure\"><jats:graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"564145v1_ufig1\" position=\"float\" orientation=\"portrait\" /></jats:fig></jats:sec>"],"publicationDate":"2023-10-27","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"id":"doi_________::58fa5ac12371d88612b90fc1cf51a93b","originalId":["10.1101/2023.10.26.564145"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1101/2023.10.26.564145"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:59.234","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1698813953257,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":3.6588395E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1101/2023.10.26.564145"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.26.564145"],"publicationDate":"2023-10-27","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This brings a new set of challenges for managing the network due to the diversity and the sheer size of the network. It will be necessary for the network to largely manage itself and deal with organisation, configuration, security, and optimisation issues. This paper proposes an architecture of an autonomic self-managing network based on Network Function Virtualization, which is capable of achieving or balancing objectives such as high QoS, low energy usage and operational efficiency. The main novelty of the architecture is the Cognitive Smart Engine introduced to enable Machine Learning, particularly (near) real-time learning, in order to dynamically adapt resources to the immediate requirements of the virtual network functions, while minimizing performance degradations to fulfill SLA requirements.

ADT often results in extensive side effects including increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. Many ADT side effects can be influenced by exercise, both resistance and aerobic training. Exercise regimes typically combine aerobic and resistance exercise but the appropriate emphasis for achieving the broadest range of therapeutic benefits has yet to be determined. We propose to determine the feasibility of undertaking a larger trial comparing a resistance- vs an aerobic-emphasised exercise intervention in men with prostate cancer undergoing ADT. The trial will also investigate preliminary evidence of difference between arms for cardiometabolic health and quality of life outcomes.This is a 6-month randomised two-armed feasibility trial. Prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT and radiotherapy will be recruited (n = 24) and randomised to either a resistance- or aerobic-emphasised group. Participants will attend twice-weekly supervised individual or small group sessions, with 75% of exercise time in the primary exercise modality. The primary outcome will be feasibility, determined via assessment of recruitment, retention, adherence, safety, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life, body composition, vascular indices, aerobic and muscular fitness and cardiometabolic health blood biomarkers.It is envisaged that the trial will provide valuable information and preliminary difference data that will aid in the design of an efficacious larger trial that will adopt a major and minor emphasis approach to the scheduling of resistance and aerobic exercise."],"publicationDate":"2024-01-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Contemporary Clinical Trials","issnPrinted":"1551-7144","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":"107388","vol":"136","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::0c47684d5aac4a3dd08ebc118e821714","originalId":["S1551714423003117","10.1016/j.cct.2023.107388","37972755"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.cct.2023.107388"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"37972755"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:42.546","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":2.298287E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"projects":[{"id":"501100002081::1e5e62235d094afd01cd56e65112fc63","code":"unidentified","acronym":null,"title":"unidentified","funder":{"shortName":"IRC","name":"Irish Research Council","jurisdiction":"IE","fundingStream":null},"provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.900"},"validated":null}],"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.cct.2023.107388"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"hybrid"},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2023.107388"],"publicationDate":"2024-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::ad03fb84c0d8d3ae454709847398c668","value":"Contemporary Clinical Trials"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"37972755"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.cct.2023.107388"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37972755"],"publicationDate":"2023-06-19","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

While sonication alone is not adequate for inactivation of various spoilage and harmful enzymes present in food, ultrasound in combination with mild heat treatment and/or pressure has shown potential for both enzyme and pathogen inactivation. Numerous studies have investigated ultrasound for inactivating enzymes such as pectinmethylesterase, polyphenoloxidases and peroxidases responsible for deterioration of fruit & vegetable juice and various enzymes pertinent to milk quality. The efficacy of ultrasound for the inactivation of enzymes in food is outlined in this review along with a description of the inactivation mechanism to elucidate the effect of ultrasound on important enzymes in fruit juices and dairy products."],"publicationDate":"2010-07-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref","Articles"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology","issnPrinted":"0924-2244","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":"367","iss":null,"sp":"358","vol":"21","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::0d9142e93a1cd8d83916d60c37a8fea5","originalId":["S0924224410001093","10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:schfsehart-1129","2124318883"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2124318883"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:10.936","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":341.0,"influence":2.0396557E-8,"popularity":1.7399054E-7,"impulse":34.0,"citationClass":"C3","influenceClass":"C3","impulseClass":"C3","popularityClass":"C3"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Elsevier TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007"],"publicationDate":"2010-07-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::e1c753acd0140ec6ee44e9fb4c543fb1","value":"Trends in Food Science & Technology"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"green"},"type":"Article","url":["https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=schfsehart"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::e1c753acd0140ec6ee44e9fb4c543fb1","value":"Trends in Food Science & Technology"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/context/schfsehart/article/1129/viewcontent/Revised_Manuscript_bk080210pbtracked150210TIFS.pdf"],"publicationDate":"2010-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2124318883"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.tifs.2010.04.007"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-8b57f825-a53f-3dc8-885b-4567c92b2421","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224410001093","https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103228366","https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20103228366.html","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/schfsehart/129/","https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1129&context=schfsehart"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::e1c753acd0140ec6ee44e9fb4c543fb1","value":"Trends in Food Science & Technology"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Online peer support groups, driven by the widespread use of mobile phones and social media, have gained popularity among people seeking health condition management advice. This position paper examines the role of online peer support groups within a behaviour change intervention, MOV’D (Move Often eVery Day), which promotes physical activity and reduces sedentary behavior in the workplace. We conducted a thematic analysis of post-study interviews from two randomized control trials to identify the benefits and limitations of online peer support groups and provide recommendations for improvement. We found that participation in online peer support groups contributes to a sense of belonging and accountability, helps to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and application of the intervention content, and serves as reminders encouraging physical activity throughout the day. Howev er, participants do not always have enough time and cognitive resources to read all the messages and actively participate in the group chats.

Due to the versatile metabolic machinery and their potential for adaptation to fluctuating environmental conditions Pseudomonas sp. are of great interest for biotechnological applications. In this study, a new extracellularly produced lipolytic enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. (P. reinekei) was purified and characterized. The production of lipase from P. reinekei (H1) was enhanced 10-fold by optimizing the nitrogen source. The 50 kDa H1 lipase was purified using negative and positive mode anion exchange chromatography. The purified lipase was active over a broad pH range (5.0-9.0) and was stable for 24 h at 40 °C. The lipase showed significant stability, and indeed activation, in the presence of organic solvents with log P ≥ 2.0. These features render this lipase of interest as a biocatalyst for applications such as biodiesel production, detergent formulations and biodegradation of oil in the environment."],"publicationDate":"2019-01-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref","Articles"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":["Technological University Dublin","Fiosraigh

This study was designed to develop a comprehensive framework of competency standards for ophthalmic technicians and optometrists, in Mozambique. This could then inform the evolution of socially responsive curricula for both cadres.A modified Delphi technique was used with a ten member expert panel consisting of optometrists, ophthalmic technicians and ophthalmologists, all with experience of working in a developing country context. The competencies were derived from literature, primary research data and observations from a competency development workshop. The first round involved scoring the relevance of two frameworks, one for each cadre, using a nine-point Likert scale with a free-text option to modify any competency or suggest additional competencies. The revised frameworks were subjected to a second round of scoring and free-text comment. The final versions of the agreed frameworks were sent out to the relevant stakeholders.There was a 100 per cent response to round 1 and an 89 per cent response to round 2. The final versions of the competency frameworks contained six competencies, 20 elements and 88 performance criteria for optometry and six competencies, 17 elements and 61 performance criteria for ophthalmic technicians.Application of a consensus methodology consisting of a modified Delphi technique with primary research data allowed the development of competency frameworks for ophthalmic technicians and optometrists.

To do so, we propose a collection of ontologies that represents the defined information model.

This paper presents a study of the degradation of auditory nerve (AN) responses at a phonetic level for a range of sensorineural hearing losses. The AN model of Zilany & Bruce was used to compute responses to a diverse set of phoneme rich sentences from the TIMIT database. The characteristics of both the average discharge rate and spike timing of the responses are discussed. The experiments demonstrate that the model responses are consistent with respect to impairment and inaudible thresholds."],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","publisher":"IET","source":["Crossref","Conference papers"],"format":["1-6","application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"IET Irish Signals and Systems Conference (ISSC 2009)","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":null,"vol":null,"edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::22cb25e29f75c0f77081d6c164bb8f30","originalId":["10.1049/cp.2009.1683","oai:tara.tcd.ie:2262/39298","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:scschcomcon-1166","2015089643"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1049/cp.2009.1683"},{"scheme":"handle","value":"2262/39298"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2015089643"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:01.103","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":1.0,"influence":3.148341E-9,"popularity":6.0776295E-10,"impulse":1.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"},{"key":"opendoar____::210f760a89db30aa72ca258a3483cc7f","value":"Trinity's Access to Research Archive"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1049/cp.2009.1683"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2009.1683"],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1049/cp.2009.1683"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"green"},"type":"Article","url":["http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/39298/1/Measurement.pdf"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"handle","value":"2262/39298"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["http://people.tcd.ie/nharte","https://hdl.handle.net/2262/39298"],"refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::210f760a89db30aa72ca258a3483cc7f","value":"Trinity's Access to Research Archive"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::210f760a89db30aa72ca258a3483cc7f","value":"Trinity's Access to Research Archive"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1049/cp.2009.1683"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/scschcomcon/161"],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2015089643"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1049/cp.2009.1683"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/scschcomcon/161/","https://arrow.dit.ie/scschcomcon/161/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&context=scschcomcon","https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/conferences/10.1049/cp.2009.1683","http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/2262/39298/1/Measurement.pdf","http://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/39298"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This method was used in the assessment of twenty-one (n = 21) elements (Al, Au, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Pt, Sn, Ti, Tl, V) to evaluate the safety of thirty-six (n = 36) protein powder samples that were commercially available in the Irish marketplace in 2016/2017. Using the determined concentrations of elements in samples (µg·kg−1), a human health risk assessment was carried out to evaluate the potential carcinogenic and other risks to consumers of these products. While the concentrations of potentially toxic elements were found to be at acceptable levels, the results suggest that excessive and prolonged use of some of these products may place consumers at a slightly elevated risk for developing cancer or other negative health impacts throughout their lifetimes. Thus, the excessive use of these products is to be cautioned, and consumers are encouraged to follow manufacturer serving recommendations.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2021-07-18","publisher":"MDPI

The literature review examines the importance of age, and cognitive and social development in this field, and considers whether or not children can distinguish between television programming and advertising. What the literature review illustrates is that research studies thus far have conflicting viewpoints on these areas. Within the research to date, there are also a number of important issues which do not seem to be addressed. Most notably, there is little research which considers the impact of advertising upon children, from the child's persepctive. This paper thus proposes an exploratory framework which aims to consider the established and potential mediating variables in the child's understanding of advertising intent."],"publicationDate":"2002-06-01","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","source":["Crossref","Articles"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Journal of Marketing Management","issnPrinted":"0267-257X","issnOnline":"1472-1376","issnLinking":null,"ep":"499","iss":null,"sp":"481","vol":"18","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::2a74906e254146b0dc3248b8d7a0c106","originalId":["10.1362/0267257022683659","10.21427/d7vr3p","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:buschmarart-1091","2155399835"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1362/0267257022683659"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7vr3p"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2155399835"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:15:31.563","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":17.0,"influence":3.928518E-9,"popularity":7.386774E-10,"impulse":4.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1362/0267257022683659"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1362/0267257022683659"],"publicationDate":"2002-06-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::a6342970f51a1d37070a80798249eb95","value":"Journal of Marketing Management"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1362/0267257022683659"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"green"},"type":"Article","url":["https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1091&context=buschmarart"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::a6342970f51a1d37070a80798249eb95","value":"Journal of Marketing Management"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7vr3p"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/d7vr3p"],"publicationDate":"2002-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7vr3p"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/buschmarart/79"],"publicationDate":"2002-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2155399835"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7vr3p"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1362/0267257022683659","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1091&context=buschmarart","https://arrow.dit.ie/buschmarart/79/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/buschmarart/79/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::a6342970f51a1d37070a80798249eb95","value":"Journal of Marketing Management"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Ireland’s only indigenous fossil fuel is peat; all other fossil fuels are imported. As well as fossil fuels continually becoming more expensive, their use as an energy source also has a negative impact on the environment. Ireland’s energy consumption can be separated into 3 divisions; transportation, electricity generation and heat energy. Ireland however has a vast range of high quality renewable energy resources. Ireland has set a target of 33% of its electricity will be generated from renewable sources by 2020[1]. The use of biomass, wind and ocean energy technologies is expected to play a major part in meeting this target. The use of renewable energy technologies will assist sustainable development as well as being a solution to several energy related environmental problems.

The study reveals that the strategies for planning and designing typically employed in the field of architecture reflect the sort of non-linear, iterative, and synthesizing processes scholars recommend universities use to improve the effectiveness of strategic planning (Birnbaum, 1988; Cutright, 2001; Presley & Leslie, 1999; Rowley, Lujan, & Dolence, 1998; Swenk, 2001). Opportunities abound for using design processes to enhance various institutional operations as explored in Proposal for using a studio format to enhance institutional advancement (Chance, 2008) and Assessing university strategic plans: A tool for consideration (Chance & Williams, in press). An overarching theme is that the architectural design studio provides an optimal example of (a) how to use iterative processes in planning and (b) how to teach holistic, critical thinking to students. This particular paper focuses on using iterative design strategies to enhance formal planning processes."],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","publisher":"Dublin Institute of Technology","source":["Conference papers"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::3b0317754b37547b0f026734b7d2e161","originalId":["10.21427/d7jv5p","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:engschcivcon-1085","2240348901"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7jv5p"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2240348901"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:16:11.560","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":1.0,"influence":3.1225742E-9,"popularity":6.23762E-10,"impulse":1.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7jv5p"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/d7jv5p"],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7jv5p"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/engschcivcon/84"],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2240348901"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7jv5p"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&context=engschcivcon","https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1085&context=engschcivcon","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/engschcivcon/84/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

ML classification models using participant profiling information as input were developed to predict the extent to which an individual was influenced by statements that contained different linguistic styles/persuasion techniques.

Most PC efforts are targeted at groups such as users, clients, shoppers and voters with this study in the communication context of education – further research is required to explore the capability of predictive ML models in other contexts. Finally, long self-reported psychological questionnaires may not be suitable for real-world deployment and could be subject to bias, thus a simpler method needs to be devised to gather user profile data such as using a subset of the most predictive features.</jats:p> </jats:sec> <jats:sec> <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title> <jats:p>The findings of this study indicate that leveraging richer profiling data in conjunction with ML approaches may assist in the development of enhanced persuasive systems.

In line with global trends, indicators of poor mental health (including rates of depression and suicide) are increasing alongside rates of unemployment and social isolation. Despite the growing awareness of men’s health as a national priority, and development of the first National Men’s Health Policy in the world, there is still a concern about men’s nonengagement with health services. Health and community services often struggle to appropriately accommodate men, and men commonly avoid health spaces. A growing body of literature suggests that a persistent lack of support or resources for service providers contributes to their inability to identify and meet men’s unique health needs. This study aims to provide further insight into the ways in which this gap between men and health services can be closed. Semistructured, qualitative interviews were conducted with nine project partners ( n = 9) of a successful men’s health program in Dublin. Interviews captured reflections on what processes or strategies contribute to effective men’s health programs. Findings suggest that gender-specific strategies—especially related to community—engagement and capacity building—are necessary in creating health programs that both promote men’s health and enable men to safely and comfortably participate. Moreover, including men in all aspects of the planning stages helps ensure that programs are accessible and acceptable for men. These findings have been operationalized into a user-driven resource that illustrates evidence-informed strategies and guiding principles that can be used by practitioners hoping to engage with men.

The technique has continued to be optimised over the years, with primer choice repeatedly being a vital factor for dietary inferences. However, the majority of dietary studies examining the effect of primer choice often rely on in silico analyses or comparing between species that occupy an identical niche type. Here, we apply DNA metabarcoding to empirically compare the prey detection capabilities of two widely used primer sets when assessing the diets of a flying (lesser horseshoe bat; <jats:italic>Rhinolophus hipposideros</jats:italic>) and two ground-dwelling insectivores (greater white-toothed shrew; <jats:italic>Crocidura russula</jats:italic> and pygmy shrew; <jats:italic>Sorex minutus</jats:italic>). Although <jats:italic>R. hipposideros</jats:italic> primarily rely on two prey orders (Lepidoptera and Diptera), the unique taxa detected by each primer shows that a combination of primers may be the best approach to fully describe bat trophic ecology. However, random forest classifier analysis suggests that one highly degenerate primer set detected the majority of both shrews’ diet despite higher levels of host amplification. The wide range of prey consumed by ground-dwelling insectivores can therefore be accurately documented from using a single broad-range primer set, which can decrease cost and labour. The results presented here show that dietary inferences will differ depending on the primer or primer combination used for insectivores occupying different niches (i.e., hunting in the air or ground)

Selectivity for this template was achieved using a 3-monomer sol-gel system utilising solid phase extraction (SPE). Analysis of the template and its related substances was achieved using HPLC. The effect of solvent polarity on the rebinding of the template was studied. Through optimisation of porogen and extraction solvent, the imprinted material (MIP) demonstrated enhanced selectivity, for the template, over a non-imprinted material (NIP). Selectivity was also illustrated for the original template over two of its related substances. The effect of starting monomer ratio on selectivity was studied to determine the interactions, which could best be exploited to further enhance selectivity."],"publicationDate":"2004-12-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","issnPrinted":"0956-5663","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":"1050","iss":null,"sp":"1045","vol":"20","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::49aecc308c9965e22f808ea13e89cb73","originalId":["S0956566304002982","10.1016/j.bios.2004.04.029","15556347","2008908065"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.bios.2004.04.029"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"15556347"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2008908065"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:53.339","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":44.0,"influence":6.5148487E-9,"popularity":5.835307E-9,"impulse":7.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C4","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.bios.2004.04.029"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Elsevier TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2004.04.029"],"publicationDate":"2004-12-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::f5ad89480e8255b77908bec3eb84dc6d","value":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"15556347"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.bios.2004.04.029"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15556347"],"publicationDate":"2003-11-19","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::f5ad89480e8255b77908bec3eb84dc6d","value":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2008908065"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.bios.2004.04.029"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15556347","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566304002982","http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15556347","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566304002982"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::f5ad89480e8255b77908bec3eb84dc6d","value":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This chapter looks at social tagging from an educational perspective, particularly its use for educational environments. The authors identify the processes underlying social tagging from an embodied interaction perspective. The authors will support the thesis that emerging folksonomies are at the base of meaningful interaction processes between user and system and also, at the same time, social processes between groups of people. This chapter argues that the fuzzy line between private and public space plays a crucial role. Moreover, tags represent embodied conceptualizations, whose potential effectiveness for learning will be discussed in this chapter. The authors will provide an example of a learning software for children (Amici, implemented by one of the authors) in which social tagging is used to support sharing in a programming environment to showcase how embodiment of conceptualization as well as constant coupling through moving between private and public space is achieved through tagging in the system.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2010-05-25","publisher":"IGI Global","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"id":"doi_dedup___::4c9f4e6c4ce489f84b446d2eab33af1f","originalId":["10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch509","10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch5.9","10.4018/978-1-60566-938-0.ch011","2495103281"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch509"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch5.9"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-60566-938-0.ch011"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2495103281"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:16:35.335","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":6.5821576E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch509"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch509"],"publicationDate":"2012-01-26","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch5.9"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-61350-456-7.ch5.9"],"publicationDate":"2013-05-03","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-60566-938-0.ch011"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-60566-938-0.ch011"],"publicationDate":"2010-05-25","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2495103281"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/978-1-60566-938-0.ch011"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/social-tagging-learning/40538","https://publications.hs-neu-ulm.de/1027/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The objective of this study was to develop a method to control payload weight by knowing the moisture content of the wood. Weights, volumes, and moisture content were gathered from 100 truckloads of Sitka spruce pulpwood. Truck volume and weight utilization patterns were analyzed based on stacked volume, truck volume, and weights recorded from the weighbridge. Solid/bulk volume conversion factors for the truckloads were estimated indicating the truck’s solid volume capacity to be filled. Trucks were grouped into five conditions based on their configuration—volume capacity and legal maximum payload. A loaded volume fraction was estimated to assess the optimal volume capacity and stanchion height at which the trucks should be loaded. Results showed that 100% of the trucks presented volume underutilization, with a maximum of 27.5 m 3 (only 39.85% volume capacity). In contrast, 67% of trucks were overweight while the remaining 33% were under the legal maximum weight. The average solid/bulk volume conversion factor was 0.66 ± 0.013 at 95% confidence level. Depending on the conditions, trucks can be filled to 100% of their volume capacity with wood at an MC from 29% to 55%. The minimum truck volume capacity utilization was 45%. This methodology can be used by truck hauliers, enabling them to determine in-forest the optimum volume and weight of wood to be transported by knowing the moisture content (MC), the wood specie, and using the height of the stanchions of the trailer as reference when loading the truck."],"publicationDate":"2015-03-12","publisher":"MDPI AG","source":["Crossref","Sustainability","Volume 7","Issue 3","Pages 3017-3030","Sustainability, Vol 7, Iss 3, Pp 3017-3030 (2015)"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Sustainability","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":"2071-1050","issnLinking":null,"ep":"3030","iss":null,"sp":"3017","vol":"7","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::4f16656f095da77e7d335f989df2bdf1","originalId":["su7033017","10.3390/su7033017","oai:RePEc:gam:jsusta:v:7:y:2015:i:3:p:3017-3030:d:46723","oai:researchrepository.ucd.ie:10197/6457","oai:mdpi.com:/2071-1050/7/3/3017/","1966106255","oai:doaj.org/article:768a6b1f279f45a2929c004058ab3361"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3390/su7033017"},{"scheme":"handle","value":"10197/6457"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1966106255"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:52.283","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":16.0,"influence":5.1558082E-9,"popularity":1.530844E-8,"impulse":3.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C4","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"beopen","label":"Transport Research","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"enermaps","label":"Welcome to EnerMaps Gateway!

Students’ prior knowledge of mathematics is a key factor in predicting whether they will succeed in engineering or not. A poor grasp of key mathematical skills typically leads to students failing to achieve the learning outcomes of technical modules. Consequently, mathematics is often the focus of engineering education research. A decline in core mathematical skills; the lowering of entry requirements and the diversity of the student cohort, all contribute to the need for a more comprehensive learning support system. Today’s students are immersed in an increasingly technological world and are willing to adapt to new technological advances. In order to increase engagement and retention rates a pedagogical shift from the more traditional hierarchical approach to learning to one that embraces the use of technology as a tool to enhance the student learning experience is required. This paper outlines a study being undertaken in the College of Engineering and Built Environment at the Technological University Dublin to create an on-line platform of resources which allows first year engineering students to consolidate and reinforce the mathematical knowledge required to succeed in engineering. By including the student as co-creator of these resources a deeper learning experience is achieved."],"publicationDate":"2014-01-01","publisher":"Dublin Institute of Technology","source":["Conference papers"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::4f3e023f11e8e6b21de9ed58fa3efda9","originalId":["10.21427/d70b8p","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:engschcivcon-1063","319137457"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d70b8p"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"319137457"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:04.119","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":1.0,"influence":3.070772E-9,"popularity":1.0541547E-9,"impulse":1.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d70b8p"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/d70b8p"],"publicationDate":"2014-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d70b8p"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/engschcivcon/62"],"publicationDate":"2014-09-11","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"319137457"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d70b8p"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/engschcivcon/62/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1063&context=engschcivcon","https://arrow.dit.ie/engschcivcon/62/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Some of the important characteristics of service environments are that they are dynamic, distributed and loosely coupled. These characteristics result in the existence of different levels of functional and non-functional attributes of the services operating in such environments. Consequently, it creates challenges for interacting service consumers that require to only deal with services that are trustworthy. In service compositions, the component services may be mandatory or optional and vary in their contribution to the trustworthiness of the composite service. Composition techniques must be able to select trustworthy components and to dynamically adapt to subsequent changes in the services and the environment. The availability of multiple services providing the same or similar functionality but with different trustworthiness levels helps composite service providers to establish and maintain trustworthy compositions."],"publicationDate":"2014-01-01","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","source":["Crossref","Secure and Trustworthy Service Composition ISBN: 9783319135175"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::4f7acd213df03fcee18a09f1a6a7dc26","originalId":["10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11","2175368330"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2175368330"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:39.145","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":1.0422565E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Springer Nature TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11"],"publicationDate":"2014-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2175368330"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-13518-2_11.pdf","https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11","https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/series/lncs/lncs8900.html#ElshaafiMB14","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13518-2_11"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Vibrations were measured on the seat and the cabin chassis in three orthogonal (x, y, z) axes for the tree felling and processing, and during motion on a test track. It was found that the level of vibration transmitted to the operator during felling and processing was mainly affected by the tree size (diameter). For tree diameter at breast height (dbh) range of 0.25-0.35 m that was investigated, the vertical (z-axis) vibration component during processing increased by up to 300%, and increased by 50% during felling. However, the associated vibration levels were not sufficient to pose any serious health risks to the operator for an exposure limit of 8 h. Vibration at the operator seat and cabin chassis was predominant in the lateral (y-axis) and vertical (z-axis) respectively, during vehicle motion over the standard test track. Vibration peaks of approximately 0.20 and 0.17 ms(-2) occurred at 5 and 3.2 Hz respectively."],"publicationDate":"2004-09-15","publisher":"Informa UK Limited","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"container":{"name":"Ergonomics","issnPrinted":"0014-0139","issnOnline":"1366-5847","issnLinking":null,"ep":"1159","iss":null,"sp":"1145","vol":"47","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::5169ea400279ba185689320c3ebfece3","originalId":["10.1080/00140130410001702141","15370853","2026500904"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1080/00140130410001702141"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"15370853"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2026500904"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:19.522","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":22.0,"influence":4.734451E-9,"popularity":6.6951964E-9,"impulse":1.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C4","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"rural-digital-europe","label":"Assessing the socio-economic impact of digitalisation in rural areas","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1080/00140130410001702141"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1080/00140130410001702141"],"publicationDate":"2004-09-15","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::f22207e7647c51d93193735320b8c3cd","value":"Ergonomics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"15370853"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1080/00140130410001702141"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15370853"],"publicationDate":"2004-09-17","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::f22207e7647c51d93193735320b8c3cd","value":"Ergonomics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2026500904"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1080/00140130410001702141"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140130410001702141","http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15370853"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::f22207e7647c51d93193735320b8c3cd","value":"Ergonomics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

More specifically, digitally enabled food delivery has emerged as the most disruptive force in the foodservice industry today. Increased consumer demand for convenience and variety in conjunction with the rapid pace of technological advancements are believed to be the driving factors for the emergence of this phenomenon (Carsten et al., 2016). Foot traffic at traditional dine-in establishments has dwindled as customers opt for online delivery instead, resulting in an altering of the restaurant value chain (Huang, Kohli and Lal, 2019). In particular, the emergence of third-party delivery aggregators (TPDA), such as Grubhub and Uber Eats, present traditional, brick and mortar foodservice operators with a multitude of both opportunities and challenges. Opportunities range from lower financial and logistical barriers for marketplace entrance, to accessing new and more extensive geographical markets, as well as the opportunity for increased sales volumes (Maras, 2019). However, it has been reported that large commission and services fees (5 to 40% on each delivery order) paid to the TPDAs by restaurants are consuming already narrow profit margins (Fisher, 2019).

An innovative, authentic learning initiative has been designed and implemented in which Master of Sustainable Energy students conducted team-based role-playing activities, responding to a realistic, hypothetical energy policy scenario in the form of a government announcement and other mock collateral. Groups were assigned the personas of a range of industry stakeholders and prepared presentations (and accompanying media statements and position papers) for a mock online media conference. The initiative leveraged the diversity of the cohort, enabling constructive interactions and an appreciation of the impacts of energy policy on a variety of organisations and wider society. Entry and exit surveys affirmed that participants gained a deeper understanding of key issues, constraints, alternative views and approaches involved in navigating the policy pathways to sustainability. The teaching staff also observed a high level of student engagement. Challenges of group dynamics and teaching effort were felt to be outweighed by the benefits reaped by students, particularly in terms of deeper conceptual knowledge and an understanding of perspectives in the energy transition. The case study also found that the online nature of the media conference enhanced student innovation and engagement.

The old seating was not being utilised by the students. Engineering courses often present challenging assignments to students; literature shows that access to information, knowledge exchanges and opportunities for learning through social interaction can be crucial to student success. Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) has grown as an important agenda item across society. Therefore, the methodology used in this redesign was inclusive design. Inclusive design is a design framework that takes into account the diversity of the human race and embraces co-design to ensure no one is excluded. It is “…not designing one product for all people; instead, it’s designing a diversity of ways to participate so that everyone has a sense of belonging”(Holmes 2018). The design team on this project was composed of a voluntary, diverse group of students and staff. The data collection methods employed was a design walk through of the University, a faculty-wide survey, and a design hackathon. The inclusive design process resulted in various social seating designs that addressed the needs of a broad range of users, including those with physical disabilities and sensory impairments. The final designs are available for perusal in Appendix 2, that show a more inclusive space for students and staff to interact and collaborate. The findings of this study highlight the importance of using an inclusive design process when designing academic environments. By involving a diverse group of stakeholders in the design process, the resulting spaces can better cater to the needs of all users. The recommendation is for other higher education institutions to consider implementing inclusive design principles in their design processes to ensure all members of their community are catered for, leading to a more inclusive and accessible academic environment for all."],"publicationDate":"2023-01-01","publisher":"European Society for Engineering Education (SEFI)","source":["Practice Papers"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::5846934812708854a35fb75a89f1939b","originalId":["10.21427/jth9-pw09","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:sefi2023_prapap-1044"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/jth9-pw09"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:28.681","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":3.6588395E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/jth9-pw09"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Conference object","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/jth9-pw09"],"publicationDate":"2023-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/jth9-pw09"}],"license":"CC BY NC SA","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/sefi2023_prapap/45"],"publicationDate":"2023-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

However, the behavioural effects of microplastic ingestion have not been explored to the same degree, even in species with documented microplastic ingestion. In this study, the predator-avoidance emergence response of Littorina littorea was assessed and related to microplastic levels within the samples. This is a novel approach to microplastic behavioural experiments, whereby current environmental L. littorea microplastic levels are assessed, rather than levels vastly in excess of those recorded under field conditions. The results showed no difference in emergence likelihood or emergence latency related to microplastic abundance, sex, or treatment. However, L. littorea size did have a significant effect on emergence likelihood and emergence latency, with smaller individuals emerging faster and more frequently.

In the same line, Web technologies will make managing, communicating and visualizing any information provided by these devices attractive to the end users and application developers. Most of the new devices connected to this Web of Things (WoT) will be embedded and wirelessly connected. However, current Web technologies have been developed with powerful devices in mind not being suited for this kind of constrained environment. In order to make the WoT a reality for low power embedded networks, specialised protocols that consider the energy, memory and processing constraints of wireless embedded devices must be designed. The IETF recently created the CoRE group whose first goal has been developing a Restful application layer protocol for communications within embedded wireless networks referred to as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The year 2011 has seen a big push in the research community towards evaluating the performance and features of CoAP protocol, indicating a growing interest in the community towards Restful interactions in low power wireless embedded networks. This paper analyses those recent advances to provide a clear picture on what has been achieved so far in the evaluation and development of the Constrained Application Protocol."],"publicationDate":"2012-07-01","publisher":"IEEE","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"container":{"name":"2012 Sixth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":null,"vol":null,"edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::5882ed3c562cac0015a6a50a8e43f5f7","originalId":["10.1109/imis.2012.93","2052165387"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/imis.2012.93"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2052165387"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:20.585","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":33.0,"influence":7.8791444E-9,"popularity":1.2161366E-8,"impulse":12.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C4","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"edih-adria","label":"EDIH Adria Matchmaking Platform","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/imis.2012.93"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1109/imis.2012.93"],"publicationDate":"2012-07-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2052165387"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/imis.2012.93"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6296940/","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6296940/","https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/imis/imis2012.html#VillaverdePAFB12","http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006296940"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

What constitutes cheating is however quite context-specific and subjective, and there is no universal view. Thus our approach aims to adjust to the particular forms of cheating to which players object rather than deciding a priori which forms of cheating should be controlled. The main feature of our approach is an architecture and model for maintaining player-based and context-appropriate trust and reputation measures, with the integration of these into the game’s ranking system. When an avatar loses reputation, our approach intervenes to reduce its ranking. It is envisaged that players will come to attach value to reputation in its own right. We also present the results of relatively large-scale simulations of various scenarios involving sequences of encounters between players, with an initial implementation of our reputation and ranking model in place, to observe the impact on cheaters (and non-cheaters)."],"publicationDate":"2010-06-19","publisher":"ACM","source":["Crossref"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":null,"vol":null,"edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::61ed1ad82845fd1d8d53cb420f584612","originalId":["10.1145/1822348.1822351","10.1145/1822348","oai:eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie:2758","1969342781"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1145/1822348.1822351"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1969342781"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:52.409","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":10.0,"influence":3.5343053E-9,"popularity":7.2147412E-9,"impulse":3.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"opendoar____::115f89503138416a242f40fb7d7f338e","value":"Maynooth University ePrints &amp; eTheses Archive"},{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1145/1822348.1822351"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1145/1822348.1822351"],"publicationDate":"2010-06-19","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1145/1822348.1822351"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"green"},"type":"Article","url":["http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/2758/1/AK_p17-botvich.pdf"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1822348.1822351"],"publicationDate":"2010-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::115f89503138416a242f40fb7d7f338e","value":"Maynooth University ePrints &amp; eTheses Archive"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::115f89503138416a242f40fb7d7f338e","value":"Maynooth University ePrints &amp; eTheses Archive"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1969342781"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1145/1822348.1822351"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1822348.1822351","http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1822348.1822351","http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fdg/fdg2010.html#BotvichMOPKK10","https://doi.org/10.1145/1822348.1822351","https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fdg/fdg2010.html#BotvichMOPKK10","http://eprints.maynoothuniversity.ie/2758/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The predicted effects are most notable in the regime where the sample thickness is comparable to the source wavelength. In this work, the model is extended to sample thicknesses more representative of biological tissue sections and to include typical experimental factors which are demonstrated to reduce the predicted effects. These include integration over the range of incidence angles, varying degrees of coherence of the source and inhomogeneities in sample thickness. The latter was found to have the strongest effect on the spectral distortions and, with inhomogeneities as low as 10% of the sample thickness, the predicted distortions due to the standing wave effect are almost completely averaged out. As the majority of samples for biospectroscopy are prepared by cutting a cross section of tissue resulting in a high degree of thickness variation, this finding suggests that the standing wave effect should be a minor distortion in FT-IR spectroscopy of tissues. The study has important implications not only in optimization of protocols for future studies, but notably for the validity of the extensive studies which have been performed to date on tissue samples

However, breastfeeding is at times supplemented or replaced with suitable alternatives. Infant formula (IF) is an industrially produced food intended as a breast milk substitute, which needs to satisfy, by itself, all nutritional requirements of infants. For this reason, it is of critical importance that IF provides the adequate amounts of nutrients including carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a promising emission spectroscopic technique for elemental analysis, which can provide real-time measurements with little to no sample preparation. Hence, the main goal of this thesis was to investigate the feasibility of LIBS as a quality tool for mineral analysis in infant formula manufacture. Experiments conducted in this work encompassed the determination of calcium and sodium contents in powdered IF samples, pelletising samples as the only sample preparation procedure; and ready-to-feed IF formula samples, by direct analysis of liquids without sample preparation."],"publicationDate":"2019-01-01","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"id":"doi_dedup___::6837e797b8280ef5a49245ca5e567958","originalId":["10.21427/dcm0-fn22","2979429284"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/dcm0-fn22"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2979429284"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:35.950","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":2.03792E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/dcm0-fn22"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/dcm0-fn22"],"publicationDate":"2019-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2979429284"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/dcm0-fn22"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.dit.ie/sciendoc/220/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/sciendoc/220/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This paper presents the findings of a recent postal survey of 94 Irish Construction Professionals to evaluate the incidence and causes of occupational stress. 70% of the re spondents considered that their work was having an adverse effect on their family and 55% believed that it was affecting their health. 40% have considered early retirement because of severe occupational stress, which appears to be a growing blight on Construction Professionals. The research found, not unexpectedly, that Site Managers had the most stressful roles, followed by Contracts/Project Managers and the Contractor’s Quantity Surveyors. The 4 main stressors identified were (a) volume of work, with associated time pressures, (b)administrative duties, (c) long working hours and (d) inadequate flow of communications. The research programme found that an encouraging number of Construction organisations had implemented measures to alleviate the causes of stress - these ranged from team-building exercises to specific stress-awareness programmes. An attempt was made to evaluate these initiatives, but it was found that few were really effective. Hence recommendations are put forward in this paper as to how stress management techniques might more usefully be applied to reducing occupational stress in the traditionally hardy, ‘macho’ culture of the construction industry. The present practice of “presenteeism”, whereby insecure employees work longer andlonger hours to impress bosses and gain promotion is certainly not the answer."],"publicationDate":"1998-01-01","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","source":["Conference papers"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::72028aaba2b8a24da3875d9c786a58b0","originalId":["10.21427/h9xg-xw24","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:beschreccon-1040","32451330"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/h9xg-xw24"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"32451330"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:16:28.092","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":2.0,"influence":3.0390024E-9,"popularity":1.6409424E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/h9xg-xw24"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Conference object","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/h9xg-xw24"],"publicationDate":"1998-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/h9xg-xw24"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/beschreccon/40"],"publicationDate":"1998-09-11","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"32451330"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/h9xg-xw24"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/beschreccon/40/","https://arrow.dit.ie/beschreccon/40/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1040&context=beschreccon"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The lateral resolution of the system has been estimated to be1.5 μm making it possible to access the subcellular organization. Using K-means clustering analysis, it is shown that the different subcellular compartments of individual cells can be identified and differentiated. The biochemical specificity of the information contained in the Raman spectra allows the visualization of differences in the molecular signature of the different sub-cellular structures. Furthermore, to enhance the chemical information obtained from the spectra, principal component analysis has been employed, allowing the identification of spectral windows with a high variability.

His paper concludes with the suggestion that mathematicians study the maximum value of the determinant of an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries in $\\{ \\pm 1\\}$. This is the Hadamard maximal determinant problem.&#x0D; This survey provides complete proofs of the major results obtained thus far. We focus equally on upper bounds for the determinant (achieved largely via the study of the Gram matrices), and constructive lower bounds (achieved largely via quadratic residues in finite fields and concepts from design theory). To provide an impression of the historical development of the subject, we have attempted to modernise many of the original proofs, while maintaining the underlying ideas. Thus some of the proofs have the flavour of determinant theory, and some appear in print in English for the first time.&#x0D; We survey constructions of matrices in order $n \\equiv 3 \\mod 4$, giving asymptotic analysis which has not previously appeared in the literature. We prove that there exists an infinite family of matrices achieving at least 0.48 of the maximal determinant bound. Previously the best known constant for a result of this type was 0.34.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2021-12-03","publisher":"The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics","embargoEndDate":"2021-01-01","source":["Crossref"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":"1077-8926","issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":null,"vol":"28","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::767eb5097e604c9a095a3bb6a97d8e8c","originalId":["10.37236/10367","10.48550/arxiv.2104.06756","oai:arXiv.org:2104.06756","oai:doras.dcu.ie:28743"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.37236/10367"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.48550/arxiv.2104.06756"},{"scheme":"arXiv","value":"2104.06756"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:08.420","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":1.0,"influence":3.0902811E-9,"popularity":3.9943946E-9,"impulse":1.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::07e1cd7dca89a1678042477183b7ac3f","value":"DCU Online Research Access Service"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"},{"key":"opendoar____::6f4922f45568161a8cdf4ad2299f6d23","value":"arXiv.org e-Print Archive"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.37236/10367"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.37236/10367"],"publicationDate":"2021-12-03","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"doajarticles::1cdd80d35dd6a03d4fd8c976556c4158","value":"Electronic Journal of Combinatorics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.37236/10367"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Article","url":["https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/download/v28i4p41/pdf"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"doajarticles::1cdd80d35dd6a03d4fd8c976556c4158","value":"Electronic Journal of Combinatorics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.48550/arxiv.2104.06756"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY","type":"Article","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2104.06756"],"publicationDate":"2021-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06756"],"publicationDate":"2021-04-14","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::6f4922f45568161a8cdf4ad2299f6d23","value":"arXiv.org e-Print Archive"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::6f4922f45568161a8cdf4ad2299f6d23","value":"arXiv.org e-Print Archive"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"arXiv","value":"2104.06756"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Preprint","url":["http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06756"],"publicationDate":"2021-04-14","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::6f4922f45568161a8cdf4ad2299f6d23","value":"arXiv.org e-Print Archive"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::6f4922f45568161a8cdf4ad2299f6d23","value":"arXiv.org e-Print Archive"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.37236/10367"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","publicationDate":"2021-12-03","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::07e1cd7dca89a1678042477183b7ac3f","value":"DCU Online Research Access Service"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::07e1cd7dca89a1678042477183b7ac3f","value":"DCU Online Research Access Service"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Although feeding animals forages has been proven to be more sustainable, traditional ryegrass monocultures still require a lot of input (e.g., fertilisers and pesticides). Multi-species swards, consisting of different swards, such as grasses, forage legumes and herbs, need less management and fertiliser, produce more dry matter, and also add a variety of phytochemicals into the animal diet. In particular, polyphenols have been associated with a positive impact on animal health and productivity. However, data on the phenolic composition of multi-species sward components is still scarce, and little is known about the change in concentration over the grazing season. The present study investigated the antioxidant activity of six forage species (perennial ryegrass, timothy, white clover, red clover, chicory and plantain) over the Irish grazing season, using FRAP, DPPH•• and ORAC assays. The forages were screened for individual phenolic compounds using Liquid-Chromatography-Triple-Quadruple-Mass-Spectrometry. Plantain exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity, being almost one and a half times higher than timothy and double that of chicory. Chlorogenic acid was the most abundant polyphenol in perennial ryegrass, timothy and plantain. Overall, formononetin and biochanin A levels were higher in red clover, white clover and in chicory, in comparison to other forages (p &lt; 0.05). Variations in antioxidant capacity and polyphenol composition were more significant between species (p &lt; 0.01) than between season within species (p &gt; 0.05). This study suggests that multi-species swards, regardless of the grazing month, offer a potential sustainable alternative to monoculture swards with significant antioxidant activity and nutraceutical compounds.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2022-12-30","publisher":"MDPI AG","source":["Crossref","Articles","Sustainability; Volume 15; Issue 1; Pages: 634","Sustainability, Vol 15, Iss 1, p 634 (2022)"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":["Prof. Nissreen Abu-Ghannam","Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM)","Food Institutional Research Measure (FIRM)"],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Sustainability","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":"2071-1050","issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":"634","vol":"15","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::7d682a7f0ed1a8981d19f5a1e791d3ec","originalId":["su15010634","10.3390/su15010634","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:schfsehart-1548","oai:mdpi.com:/2071-1050/15/1/634/","oai:doaj.org/article:00c7dce31b384f95a3053cb273a0f60a"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3390/su15010634"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:29.692","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":5.0,"influence":3.1508258E-9,"popularity":8.116207E-9,"impulse":5.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"beopen","label":"Transport Research","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"enermaps","label":"Welcome to EnerMaps Gateway!

We present a technique for per traffic class IP network demand estimation based on harnessing information gathered for accounting and charging purposes. This technique represents an efficient use of pre-existing information, is easy to deploy, and, crucially, is highly cost-effective in comparison to traditional direct measurement systems employing dedicated traffic metering hardware. In order to facilitate QoS-aware network planning we also introduce a technique for estimation of QoS related effective bandwidth coefficients via analysis of a relatively small number of packet traces. The combination of the demand and effective bandwidth coefficient estimation techniques provide the basis for an effective, low-cost network planning solution. In this paper we present initial results that validate our contention that network accounting records can be reused to create a QoS aware demand matrix for IP networks."],"publicationDate":"2006-01-01","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","source":["Crossref","Lecture Notes in Computer Science ISBN: 9783540477013"],"format":["text"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::805c7e03a02069139141489d9e482dee","originalId":["10.1007/11908852_11","oai:repository.wit.ie:24","1569317349"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11908852_11"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1569317349"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T23:58:46.635","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":12.0,"influence":4.746907E-9,"popularity":8.301151E-10,"impulse":6.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C4","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C5"}},"projects":[{"id":"sfi_________::09fd42811a7231a3ad278676f579fbdc","code":"04/IN3/I404C","acronym":null,"title":"Foundations of Autonomic Networking","funder":{"shortName":"SFI","name":"Science Foundation Ireland","jurisdiction":"IE","fundingStream":"SFI Principal Investigator Programme (PI)"},"provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.900"},"validated":null}],"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":null},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::50c1f44e426560f3f2cdcb3e19e39903","value":"Waterford Institute of Technology - Open Access Repository"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"opendoar____::4daa3db355ef2b0e64b472968cb70f0d","value":"SETU Open Access Repository"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11908852_11"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://doi.org/10.1007/11908852_11"],"publicationDate":"2006-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11908852_11"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["http://repository.wit.ie/24/"],"publicationDate":"2006-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::4daa3db355ef2b0e64b472968cb70f0d","value":"SETU Open Access Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::4daa3db355ef2b0e64b472968cb70f0d","value":"SETU Open Access Repository"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11908852_11"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["http://repository.wit.ie/24/1/2006_IPOM_davyA_et_al_final.pdf"],"publicationDate":"2006-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::50c1f44e426560f3f2cdcb3e19e39903","value":"Waterford Institute of Technology - Open Access Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::50c1f44e426560f3f2cdcb3e19e39903","value":"Waterford Institute of Technology - Open Access Repository"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1569317349"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11908852_11"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11908852_11","https://core.ac.uk/display/58827377","https://www.tssg.org/files/archives/2006_IPOM_davyA_et_al_final.pdf","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11908852_11","http://www.tssg.org/files/archives/2006_IPOM_davyA_et_al_final.pdf","https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ipom/ipom2006.html#DavyBJ06"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Chromatography was performed on a Zorbax Bonus-RP (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 microm). The mobile phase was a ternary gradient water-methanol-acetonitrile with 1.0 mM ammonium acetate at flow rate of 0.2 ml min(-1). The LC separation and MS/MS optimization were studied to select the most appropriate operating conditions. The method developed has also been validated. The limits of quantification (LOQs) were from 1 microg kg(-1) for carbofuran to 10 microg kg(-1) for 3-keto-7-phenolcarbofuran. Extracts spiked with carbosulfan and its metabolites, at LOQ level, yielded average recoveries in the range 60-94%, with relative standard deviations (R.S.D.s) less than 15%. Calibration curves for carbosulfan and its metabolites (range LOQ-1000LOQ) were linear, with coefficients of correlations better than 0.990. The method was successfully applied to establish the primary degradation products in oranges treated with carbosulfan. The LC-MS/MS method developed is simple, rapid, and suitable for the quantification and confirmation of carbosulfan and seven of its main metabolites in orange at levels lower than 10 microg kg(-1)."],"publicationDate":"2006-06-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Analytica Chimica Acta","issnPrinted":"0003-2670","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":"11","iss":null,"sp":"1","vol":"571","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::8140d6e5be988eb0cb4dfe0d8147e7a2","originalId":["S0003267006008683","10.1016/j.aca.2006.04.033","17723411","2054436689"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.aca.2006.04.033"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"17723411"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2054436689"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:15:37.156","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":36.0,"influence":5.9431757E-9,"popularity":5.94468E-9,"impulse":13.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C4","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"forthem","label":"FORTHEM Alliance","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.aca.2006.04.033"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Elsevier TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2006.04.033"],"publicationDate":"2006-06-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::87e96ddd8a4a801040b02f008ae1b24f","value":"Analytica Chimica Acta"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"17723411"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.aca.2006.04.033"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17723411"],"publicationDate":"2006-03-18","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2054436689"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.aca.2006.04.033"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267006008683","https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:b575c88","http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17723411","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267006008683"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::87e96ddd8a4a801040b02f008ae1b24f","value":"Analytica Chimica Acta"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Objective: To build on the existing exploratory research and investigate the impact of these micronutrients on the natural progression of AD in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Patients with mild-moderate AD consumed daily 1 g fish oil (of which 500 mg DHA, 150 mg EPA), 22 mg carotenoids (10 mg lutein, 10 mg meso-zeaxanthin, 2 mg zeaxanthin), and 15 mg vitamin E or placebo for 12 months in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Carotenoids, ω-3FAs, and vitamin E were quantified in blood. Carotenoids were also measured in skin. AD severity was measured using the mini-mental state examination and dementia severity rating scale tools. Behavior, mood, and memory were measured using an informant-based questionnaire. Results: Following 12 months of supplementation, the active group (n = 50) compared to the placebo group (n = 27), demonstrated statistically significant improvements in skin carotenoid measurements, blood carotenoids, ω-3FAs, and vitamin E concentrations (p &lt; 0.05, for all). The active group also performed better in objective measures of AD severity (i.e., memory and mood), with a statistically significant difference reported in the clinical collateral for memory (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Exponential increases in the prevalence of AD and its relentless progressive nature is driving the need for interventions that help to ameliorate symptoms and improve quality of life in AD patients. Given the positive outcomes demonstrated in this trial, this combined micronutrient dietary supplement should be considered in the overall management of AD.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2022-10-25","publisher":"IOS Press","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"container":{"name":"Journal of Alzheimer's Disease","issnPrinted":"1387-2877","issnOnline":"1875-8908","issnLinking":null,"ep":"249","iss":null,"sp":"233","vol":"90","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::83cc41f8378d9330a608a335eca6d045","originalId":["10.3233/jad-220556","36093704"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3233/jad-220556"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"36093704"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:15:31.858","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":6.0,"influence":3.0966807E-9,"popularity":1.0566989E-8,"impulse":6.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3233/jad-220556"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-220556"],"publicationDate":"2022-10-25","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::b487567f4002f85cd0e330a69c77a89a","value":"Journal of Alzheimer s Disease"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"36093704"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3233/jad-220556"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36093704"],"publicationDate":"2022-09-13","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::b487567f4002f85cd0e330a69c77a89a","value":"Journal of Alzheimer s Disease"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The results of simulations of the dynamics of this kind of system are presented and a variety of algorithmic approaches to managing trust are analysed and discussed.

Many energy efficiency technologies have failed to deliver on the promised savings. This paper measures the extent to which residential dwelling retrofit delivers real energy savings in Ireland using a unique dataset of whole-home energy use (n = 8,572 households) over a two-year period. It is one of the largest studies of retrofit using whole-home energy data for a general housing sample, who do not disproportionately experience fuel poverty. It uses whole-home energy data to capture potential fuel switching induced by retrofit. Finally, this study addresses concerns regarding self-selection issues associated with the decision to undergo a retrofit by comparing with a second control group of homes that received a retrofit prior to the observation period.  Results following a generalised difference-in-difference methodology indicate that retrofits reduce energy use by 1,091 kWh/year, on average. However, the magnitude of savings depends on the measures installed. Further analysis suggests that retrofits represent better value for money when factoring in actual changes in energy use. This study highlights possible unintended consequences of retrofit policies that may hinder progress towards national energy efficiency targets."],"publicationDate":"2021-12-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Energy Policy","issnPrinted":"0301-4215","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":"112576","vol":"159","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::92391d2014f505a2b1acd28fb8700449","originalId":["S0301421521004468","10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112576","3202544487"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.enpol.2021.112576"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"3202544487"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:16:48.108","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":6.0,"influence":3.233166E-9,"popularity":6.4656343E-9,"impulse":6.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"edih-adria","label":"EDIH Adria Matchmaking Platform","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"enermaps","label":"Welcome to EnerMaps Gateway!

In PD-NOMA, users are served at the same time and using the same frequency band, but at differing power levels. In this paper, the optimization problem for PA is formulated with distance (d), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and foliage depth (df) constraints. A fuzzy inference system (FIS) addresses the optimization problem by allocating the optimal power factors (power levels) to each user in the vicinity of a 5G base-station (gNodeB). The proposed system incorporates a cooperative relaying technique at the near-user to assist the far-user facing signal degradation and greater path losses. A realistic 5G micro-cell is analyzed for downlink PD-NOMA where superposition coding (SC) is used at the transmitter side, a successive interference cancellation (SIC) scheme at the near-user, and a maximum ratio combining (MRC) technique at the far-user’s receiver, respectively. For both simple PD-NOMA and cooperative relaying PD-NOMA, the presented technique’s bit-error-rate (BER) performance is evaluated against various SNR values, and it is concluded that cooperative PD-NOMA outperforms simple PD-NOMA. By combining the presented FIS system with cooperation relaying, the proposed FIS method guarantees user fairness in PD-NOMA systems while also significantly improving performance.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2022-04-22","publisher":"MDPI AG","source":["Crossref","Electronics; Volume 11; Issue 9; Pages: 1338","Electronics, Vol 11, Iss 9, p 1338 (2022)"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Electronics","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":"2079-9292","issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":"1338","vol":"11","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::95f4e7246ef656b1ac73b8554f80cf5b","originalId":["electronics11091338","10.3390/electronics11091338","oai:mdpi.com:/2079-9292/11/9/1338/","oai:doaj.org/article:0e5b91503ec5411ca8ea7b73bd281ff3"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3390/electronics11091338"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:58.879","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":1.0,"influence":3.030923E-9,"popularity":4.4016994E-9,"impulse":1.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::c2cdfa5866e03cdd07d313cbc8fb8311","value":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute"},{"key":"driver______::bee53aa31dc2cbb538c10c2b65fa5824","value":"DOAJ"},{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3390/electronics11091338"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11091338"],"publicationDate":"2022-04-22","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"doajarticles::7eafbabf7cf92a2542f90c01cbe124ec","value":"Electronics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3390/electronics11091338"}],"license":"CC BY","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/electronics11091338"],"publicationDate":"2022-04-22","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"doajarticles::7eafbabf7cf92a2542f90c01cbe124ec","value":"Electronics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::c2cdfa5866e03cdd07d313cbc8fb8311","value":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.3390/electronics11091338"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Article","url":["https://doaj.org/article/0e5b91503ec5411ca8ea7b73bd281ff3"],"publicationDate":"2022-04-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"doajarticles::7eafbabf7cf92a2542f90c01cbe124ec","value":"Electronics"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"driver______::bee53aa31dc2cbb538c10c2b65fa5824","value":"DOAJ"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The thesis is underpinned by an historical, musicological analysis of tuning systems and theory necessary for the performer of microtonal music. The dissertation is presented in three chapters. In Chapter One, a discussion of tuning theory and a history of temperament systems contextualises the current uses of equal temperament and extensions of it including the quarter-tone tempered system. Chapter Two introduces the breadth and influence of microtonal music from European art music, regional folk music and contemporary jazz while specifically analysing two exemplary case studies – the Arabic Maqam system and the music of the contemporary jazz saxophonist, Hayden Chisholm. Chapter Three presents the development of a new method, discussing microtonality as an expressive device for the contemporary saxophonist. This method demonstrates the use of the saxophone in microtonal music, looking at quarter-tone technical issues and the use of quarter tones in improvisation and composition within a jazz context. First, this research proves and demonstrates how the saxophone as an instrument of non-fixed intonation and therefore not confined to a fixed or single temperament system may, through a systemised method to mastering production of microtonal notes, be vastly increased in its expressive and melodic potential. Second, it demonstrates how an understanding of the history and nuance of tuning systems and alternative temperaments provides the required knowledge for effective communication and notation of the duality of contemporary intuitive, improvising performance / composition. Third, it establishes that cross-cultural studies most effectively provide the systematic, underpinning knowledge required to support the contemporary performer, drawing on ancient traditions of microtonality alongside recent innovations in contemporary music. Finally, the dissertation demonstrates that quarter-tone production is a proven viable addition to the contemporary saxophonist’s toolkit, and that it has far reaching implications for the saxophonist leading him/her to a position of greater expressive potential."],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","publisher":"Dublin Institute of Technology","source":["Dissertations"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::987aaa379ab07e829279df4635622220","originalId":["10.21427/d7z756","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:aaconmusdiss-1000","131426493"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7z756"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"131426493"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:33.103","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":5.9487604E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7z756"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/d7z756"],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7z756"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Doctoral thesis","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/aaconmusdiss/1"],"publicationDate":"2009-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"131426493"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d7z756"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://1xn.org/softspeakers/PDFs/SeanWork.pdf","https://arrow.dit.ie/aaconmusdiss/1/","http://1xn.org/softspeakers/PDFs/SeanWork.pdf","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/aaconmusdiss/1/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=aaconmusdiss"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

It can be argued that today’s third level education students are part of a new virtual era where the blackboard has been replaced with an interactive whiteboard. To assist in the transition from traditional learning to eLearning, more interactive and virtually orientated teaching aids are needed. A simulation-based learning framework that integrates web-based simulation and a web content management hierarchy model is the key objective of this paper. Using the highly complex subject of supply chain management as a case study, the new framework allows users to examine various management strategies of real-life scenarios, encourages group work and has remote access capabilities for distance learning. Interactive learning is facilitated using the web-based simulation portal, enabling instructors to demonstrate the complexity of decisions in multiple criteria environment and also show the users the impact of strategies on performance. Supply chain simulation creates an animated experience and better understanding of the system dynamics including risks. The portal interface is friendly and hence there is a potential to be applied in other subject areas."],"publicationDate":"2011-01-01","publisher":"Dublin Institute of Technology","source":["Conference papers"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":["Technological University Dublin"],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::98e0b8f49e237ef8025ac2701b4b2a19","originalId":["10.21427/d76b8j","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:buschmarcon-1082","1598665073"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d76b8j"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1598665073"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:07.302","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":7.325455E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d76b8j"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/d76b8j"],"publicationDate":"2011-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d76b8j"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/buschmarcon/81"],"publicationDate":"2011-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1598665073"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/d76b8j"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/buschmarcon/81/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context=buschmarcon","https://arrow.dit.ie/buschmarcon/81/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

With Ireland’s geographic location, genetic characteristics, and the reemergence of rickets in Ireland in the early noughties; Ireland is a part of the deficiency pandemic. Vitamin deficiencies have historically been handled effectively through food fortification schemes, however additional food products, like processed meats, need to be assessed for their ability to address the deficiency and consumer acceptance. Aim: The aim of this study is to analyse the general consumer acceptance of future Vitamin D fortified, processed meats in the Irish market, in order to reduce deficiencies. Methodology: This study used primary data gathered on an online survey platform. All variables were self-reported, opinion-based, and multiple choice. Variables pertained to demographics, vitamin D intake, food fortification, and processed meats. Chi Squared tests were used to test the relationship between Vitamin D and fortification, fortification and processed meat consumption, etc. Results: The majority of respondents believed that they do not have an adequate intake of Vitamin D, consumed processed meats and an overwhelming majority of respondents also agree with food fortification. The significance of relationships between variables and the percentages of certain responses were tested to make assumptions on the consumer acceptance and impact on Vitamin D deficiency reduction. There was a significant relationship between those who consume processed meats and those that agree with fortification. There was also a significant relationship between those that think their health would increase with increased Vitamin D intake and those that would consider buying processed meats fortified with Vitamin D. The relationship was also significant between those that regularly purchase fortified foods and those that would consider buying fortified meats fortified with Vitamin D. Conclusion: This finding of this study speaks to the possible success and reach of Vitamin D fortified processed meats. However, while correlation is plausible, the findings were not significant enough to declare that this product would be widely accepted in the market or would have a notable reduction on the population’s Vitamin D deficiency."],"publicationDate":"2020-01-01","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","source":["Theses"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":["Fintan Moran"],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::99091fa1e789a65b419ec3dd075aef13","originalId":["10.21427/7bf1-hz29","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:sfehthes-1011","3120660314"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/7bf1-hz29"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"3120660314"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:15.579","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":2.3516435E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/7bf1-hz29"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY NC SA","type":"Other literature type","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/7bf1-hz29"],"publicationDate":"2020-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/7bf1-hz29"}],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Doctoral thesis","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/sfehthes/5"],"publicationDate":"2020-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"3120660314"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/7bf1-hz29"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/sfehthes/2/","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=sfehthes"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

As computing slowly becomes a part of the upper secondary school (high school) curriculum in many countries, instruments designed to measure teachers’ programming self-esteem can help inform classroom practice and processes such as teacher professional development needs. This study examines if there are differences in programming self-esteem (using the Bergin Programming Self-Esteem Instrument) between upper secondary school teachers and CS1 students in Ireland. In addition this study provides evidence of validity when using this instrument (originally developed for CS1 students) to measure upper secondary school teacher programming self-esteem. To test for evidence of validity, we compared the results of the programming self-esteem construct given to upper secondary school teachers (n=130) to a recent study of programming selfesteem among CS1 students (n=693). We found evidence of both reliability and validity with teachers that aligns with the evidence found for the CS1 students, demonstrating utility for use with teacher cohorts. Comparing these findings, teachers reported statistically significantly lower programming self-esteem compared to CS1 students.

However, we found no statistically significant difference for teacher gender, unlike previous work.

The administrative culture, which appeared obsessed with secrecy, was linked to ideas of political reform – one of the main platforms upon which the current government ran its 2011 election campaign. In this paper, Jennifer Kavanagh argues that the workings of executive secrecy undermine a citizen’s right to engage with government policy. Some restrictions may be deemed permissible in order to protect the workings of government. In the Irish context, these restrictions are found in cabinet confidentiality, Official Secrets Act and the retrenchment of the Freedom of Information Acts. The paper highlights the extent of executive secrecy as it exists and the extent to which the executive seeks to keep the policy making process behind closed doors. This is contrasted with the implications of such secrecy on those that seek to peer behind the veil of executive secrecy by examining the Kennedy and Hamilton cases. This paper offers an insight into some of the lessons that can be learned from a closed-door policy making process and its implications for the nature of the democracy which it seeks to protect."],"publicationDate":"2012-01-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"container":{"name":"SSRN Electronic Journal","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":"1556-5068","issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":null,"vol":null,"edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::a421c4243022be0e79f2edd795ff08c7","originalId":["10.2139/ssrn.2279027","1558454924"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.2139/ssrn.2279027"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1558454924"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:03.255","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":8.197724E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.2139/ssrn.2279027"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2279027"],"publicationDate":"2012-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn__online::40ce99e275066b606ac04ff2dc8de65a","value":"SSRN Electronic Journal"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"1558454924"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.2139/ssrn.2279027"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2279027_code2075786.pdf?abstractid=2279027&mirid=5","https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2279027"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Released in 2010, the Microsoft KinectTM removed the development barrier for software developers and educational professionals interested in developing natural user interface (NUI) and voice user interfaces (VUI) learning applications. Traditional online learning methods replicate current passive learning methods such as theory lectures which are recorded and offered online via streamed video through packages such as Moodle and Adobe ConnectTM. These more established distance teaching approaches do not cater for new methods for learning or a new game-orientated student cohort, despite the availability of technology which excels at interactivity and requires a user’s active attention for successful interactions. Initial demonstrations of the augmented lectures to students illustrated an acceptance of the technology for use in teaching and learning and the augmented lectures were received positively. These augmented lectures could foster a feeling of inclusiveness and social inclusion for the online learner which could be absent from video based alternatives."],"publicationDate":"2015-03-01","publisher":"Infonomics Society","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"International Journal for Cross-Disciplinary Subjects in Education","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":"2042-6364","issnLinking":null,"ep":"2393","iss":null,"sp":"2385","vol":"5","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::ab1b02fe804cb55de0d25eb3a7446baa","originalId":["10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326","2487138064"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2487138064"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:04.730","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":1.1832216E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"edih-adria","label":"EDIH Adria Matchmaking Platform","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326"],"publicationDate":"2015-03-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn__online::7b211c2df977da247256b1fcebecc565","value":"International Journal for Cross-Disciplinary Subjects in Education"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn__online::7b211c2df977da247256b1fcebecc565","value":"International Journal for Cross-Disciplinary Subjects in Education"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2487138064"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.20533/ijcdse.2042.6364.2015.0326"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"gold"},"type":"Journal","url":["http://infonomics-society.org/wp-content/uploads/ijcdse/published-papers/special-issue-volume-5-2015/Motion-and-Audio-Capture-of-Lectures-for-Use-in-Digital-Game-Based-Learning-Environments.pdf"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn__online::7b211c2df977da247256b1fcebecc565","value":"International Journal for Cross-Disciplinary Subjects in Education"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This limitation is based on the tools ability to retrieve the relevant data and present it to the investigator in a user friendly format. The current software tools that claim to extract user activity information put the onus on the investigator to construct the timeline from the data which can introduce errors and is time consuming. This paper discusses the development and evaluation of a new tool, the User Activity Tracker (UAT), which automates the visual presentation of the timeline process by retrieving and consolidating user activity data into a single source and producing as accurately as possible, the timeline of user activity on that computer. The UAT tool was tested against a modern commercial forensic tool and the results of this preliminary testing showed that the UAT tool was faster and required less manual intervention to produce a greater level of detail of the user’s activity than the commercial tool.</p>"],"publicationDate":"2012-04-01","publisher":"IGI Global","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"container":{"name":"International Journal of Ambient Computing and Intelligence","issnPrinted":"1941-6237","issnOnline":"1941-6245","issnLinking":null,"ep":"47","iss":null,"sp":"35","vol":"4","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::b3dedc68364025d4fa0c65ebb31d590d","originalId":["10.4018/jaci.2012040103","2007819583"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/jaci.2012040103"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2007819583"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:13:53.607","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":8.197724E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"edih-adria","label":"EDIH Adria Matchmaking Platform","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/jaci.2012040103"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.4018/jaci.2012040103"],"publicationDate":"2012-04-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::6a924e14f3948ca7faca35ffc02b4db1","value":"International Journal of Ambient Computing and Intelligence"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2007819583"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.4018/jaci.2012040103"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["https://www.igi-global.com/article/automating-generation-user-activity-timelines/66858","https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijaci/ijaci4.html#OShaughnessyK12","https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:igg:jaci00:v:4:y:2012:i:2:p:35-47"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::6a924e14f3948ca7faca35ffc02b4db1","value":"International Journal of Ambient Computing and Intelligence"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Previous to this date, Irish dentists only had an ethical obligation to report. International literature indicates that dentists see themselves as having a role in child protection. However, there appears to be a significant gap between those dentists who suspect child abuse and neglect (CAN) in a given case, and those who refer the case to the relevant authorities. The aim of this study was to investigate, prior to the introduction of mandatory reporting in the Republic of Ireland, the reporting of CAN by salaried primary care dentists and to identify any barriers to reporting. Two cross-sectional surveys using web-based anonymous questionnaires were sent to all Salaried Primary Care Dental Managers (N=17) and Senior and General Dentists (N=239) in Ireland in March 2017. 64.7% (n=11) of Managers and 28% (n=67) of dentists returned questionnaires. It was found that although, 30.8% of dentists had suspected at least one case of possible CAN over the previous 12 months, only 8.1% of the HSE dentists had formally reported at least one case of concern over the same period. There were clear barriers identified to the reporting of concerns.

It is presented in tandem with a case study of student persecptions from an Academic Writing Centre and taken together, both discuss the pedagogical approach adopted by the two pan-university initiatives. The focus of this case study is a Professional Development module for Faculty designed with a dual purpose - to support them to develop their own professional writing for publication, and enabling them to use the same strategies to support and reinforce their students’ academic writing. The research design used a qualitative approach to gather three forms of data for capturing the dual perception of Faculty and students across the two case studies: Faculty survey (n=30), a Faculty focus group (n=6), and student survey (n=21). Findings across the two case studies indicate that Faculty and students hold different perceptions about the nature and effectiveness of academic writing support.

The objective of this work was to develop an analytical method to quantify and confirm the presence of triclabendazole residues around the MRL. In this work, a new analytical method was developed, which extended dynamic range to 1-100 and 5-1000 μg kg(-1) for milk and tissue, respectively. This was achieved using a mobile phase containing trifluoroacetic acid (pK(a) of 0.3), which resulted in the formation of the protonated pseudomolecular ions, [M+H](+), of triclabendazole metabolites. Insufficient ionisation of common mobile phase additives due to low pK(a) values (2) was identified as the cause of poor linearity. The new mobile phase conditions allowed the analysis of triclabendazole residues in liver, muscle and milk encompassing their EU maximum residue levels (MRL) (250, 225 and 10 μg kg(-1) respectively). Triclabendazole residues were extracted using a modified QuEChERS method and analysed by positive electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry with all analytes eluted by 2.23 min. The method was validated at the MRL according to Commission Decision (CD) 2002/657/EC criteria. The decision limit (CCα) of the method was in the range of 250.8-287.2, 2554.9-290.8 and 10.9-12.1 μg kg(-1) for liver, muscle and milk, respectively. The performance of the method was successfully verified for triclabendazole in muscle by participating in a proficiency study, the method was also applied to incurred liver, muscle and milk samples."],"publicationDate":"2013-02-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Journal of Chromatography A","issnPrinted":"0021-9673","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":"47","iss":null,"sp":"41","vol":"1275","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::cfac7c73e8148b604981beb227c14cb2","originalId":["S0021967312018766","10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.018","23290363","2091003198"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.018"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"23290363"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2091003198"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:12:30.300","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":10.0,"influence":3.6521839E-9,"popularity":3.9047205E-9,"impulse":5.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.018"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Elsevier TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.018"],"publicationDate":"2013-02-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::aabff17b6b65e4eab368373d6b417c81","value":"Journal of Chromatography A"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"23290363"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.018"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23290363"],"publicationDate":"2012-09-03","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2091003198"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.chroma.2012.12.018"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23290363","https://core.ac.uk/display/10081587","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23290363/","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967312018766","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967312018766","https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/maximum-residue-level-validation-of-triclabendazole-marker-residues-in-bovine-liver-muscle-and-milk-matrices-by-ultra-high-pressure-liquid-chromatography-tandem-mass-spectrometry(30378566-88f5-4102-b112-97e4b00be83b).html"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::aabff17b6b65e4eab368373d6b417c81","value":"Journal of Chromatography A"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The wall and bladders are made of conductive polyurethane. The background material is an ultrasound gel-based mixture, with conductivity matched to a weighted average of the pelvic cavity organs, bone, muscle and fat. The phantom boundary is developed using a computer tomography model of a male human pelvis. The bladder phantoms were designed to correlate with human bladder dimensions. Electrical impedance measurements of the phantom were recorded, and images produced using six different bladder phantoms and a realistic finite element model.Five different bladder volumes were successfully imaged using an empty bladder as a reference. The average conductivity index from the reconstructed images showed a strong positive correlation with the bladder phantom volumes.A conductively and anatomically accurate pelvic phantom was developed for non-invasive bladder volume monitoring using electrical impedance measurements. Several bladders were designed to correlate with actual human bladder volumes, allowing for accurate volume estimation. The conductivity of the phantom is accurate over 50-250 kHz. This phantom can allow changeable electrode location, contact and size; multi-layer electrodes configurations; increased complexity by addition of other organ or bone phantoms; and electrode movement and deformation. Overall, the pelvic phantom enables greater scope for experimentation and system refinement as a precursor to in-man clinical studies."],"publicationDate":"2018-03-15","publisher":"IOP

Safety training plays an important role in reducing accidents and promoting a safety culture within this sector. This article details an action research study undertaken during the first year of a new Degree in Timber Product Technology, which set out to evaluate the impact a blended learning environment and reusable learning objects (RLOs) could have on promoting safe work practices and a safety culture amongst students. A constructivist approach was taken and the module design was underpinned by Kolb’s model of experiential learning, placing more responsibility on the learners for their own learning and encouraging them to reflect upon their experiences. The findings of this study suggest that students with prior industry machining experience required a change in their attitude to machining which was achieved within the practical labs, while students with no machining experiences were intimidated by the learning environment in the practical labs but whose learning experience was enhanced through the use of RLOs and other eLearning resources. In order to reduce occupational accidents in the furniture manufacturing industry the promotion of continuing professional development (CPD) training courses is required in order to change workers’ behaviour to machine safety and encourage lifelong learning so as to promote a safety culture within the furniture manufacturing industry."],"publicationDate":"2013-01-01","publisher":"Dublin

Bivalve shellfish, both from wild populations and aquaculture, will undoubtedly continue to account for a significant portion of overall seafood production, but consumption of such shellfish carries potential health risks. Biotoxins, disease causing organisms and pollution contribute to this risk, as shellfish are indiscriminate, passive filter feeders. While government bodies, industry regulators and producers are capable of managing this risk, counterfeit produce can risk public safety, in turn damaging the reputation of the entire industry. Traceability tools provide a means to uphold food safety standards and mitigate remaining risk to consumers. Here, we show how the use of trace element (TE) signatures in shells and soft tissues of king scallops combined, can predict geographic origin with 100% accuracy. Importantly, we explore the temporal stability of this method, successfully classifying 100% of individuals correctly between two dates just 42 days apart from the same harvesting location. The most important elements in the trace element signatures of the scallops, discriminating between harvesting sites and dates were barium, boron, chromium, lead, manganese, molybdenum and selenium. The traceability tool described here offers a viable method to trace produce to its source, empowering industry regulators, government authorities, aquaculture practitioners and retailers in terms of tracking shellfish throughout the supply chain, which would comply with legislation and boost consumer confidence."],"publicationDate":"2019-12-01","publisher":"Elsevier BV","source":["Crossref"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"container":{"name":"Science of The Total Environment","issnPrinted":"0048-9697","issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":"134121","vol":"697","edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::e7b3c16f64d1e9934546195ee26f549a","originalId":["S0048969719340987","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121","32380612","2970528684"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121"},{"scheme":"pmid","value":"32380612"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2970528684"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:38.846","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":22.0,"influence":3.7825365E-9,"popularity":2.372403E-8,"impulse":16.0,"citationClass":"C4","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C4","popularityClass":"C4"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Elsevier TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121"],"publicationDate":"2019-12-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::00f0daec9ef6ecfa16d5915fba4dc271","value":"The Science of The Total Environment"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"pmid","value":"32380612"}],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121"}],"type":"Article","url":["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32380612"],"publicationDate":"2019-06-21","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::8b6dd7db9af49e67306feb59a8bdc52c","value":"Europe PubMed Central"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2970528684"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134121"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Journal","url":["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32380612","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969719340987","https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ScTEn.697m4121M/abstract"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"issn___print::00f0daec9ef6ecfa16d5915fba4dc271","value":"The Science of The Total Environment"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This paper presents a novel policy-based, context-aware, service management framework for ensuring the efficient delivery and management of next generation services using autonomic computing principles. The novelty of this approach is its use of contextual information to drive policy-based changes that adapt network services and resources. Policies control the deployment and management of services and resources, as well as the software used to create, manage, and destroy these services and resources. Policies also control the distribution and deployment of the necessary components for fully managing the service lifecycle, and provide the efficiency and scalability necessary for supporting autonomic systems."],"publicationDate":"2006-01-01","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","source":["Crossref","Autonomic Networking ISBN: 9783540458913"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::ee6939bc64191f27bc5946d0a07e9dfb","originalId":["10.1007/11880905_15","2095666504"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11880905_15"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2095666504"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:14:49.180","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":4.0,"influence":3.4329148E-9,"popularity":4.9717885E-10,"impulse":2.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"eu-conexus","label":"European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11880905_15"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"Springer TDM","accessRight":{"code":"c_14cb","label":"CLOSED","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://doi.org/10.1007/11880905_15"],"publicationDate":"2006-01-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11880905_15"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":"bronze"},"type":"Part of book or chapter of book","url":["https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11880905_15.pdf"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____:8ac8380272269217cb09a928c8caa993","value":"UnpayWall"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2095666504"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1007/11880905_15"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ifip6/an2006.html#SerranoSSC06","https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11880905_15","https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F11880905_15.pdf","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11880905_15","https://oasis.postech.ac.kr/handle/2014.oak/46908","https://doi.org/10.1007/11880905_15"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

A Box–Behnken design was constructed using three parameters viz. temperature, initial moisture content, and log number of spores to determine the optimal fermentation condition. The best fermentation conditions for xylanase production were found to be incubation at 30 °C with an initial moisture content of 70% and using an inoculum of 6.5 × 106 spores/g of dry SCW. Furthermore, the design of experiments revealed that maintaining a medium composition of 0.2 g of yeast extract, 0.04 g of K2HPO4, and 0.03 g of MgSO4 increased xylanase production. Under optimised solid-state fermentation conditions an enzyme activity of 6495.6 IU/g of dry SCW was recorded, which was approximately 1.39-fold higher than that of control (4649 IU/g of dry SCW). The efficacy of the purified xylanase as a juice enrichment agent for strawberry, blueberry, and raspberry pulp was tested.</jats:p>"],"publicationDate":"2019-11-17","publisher":"MDPI

The way companies operated had to change and many people are now encouraged to work from home. Companies have had to adapt many of their work practices and in some cases adopt new ways conducting activities such conducting and hosting of audits. The paper seeks to investigate the challenges and potential benefits with conducting remote audits. An industry-based survey was conducted to identify the challenges with conducting remote audits from the pharmaceutical industry’s perspective. To overcome some of the challenges identified an action plan is proposed to facilitate companies in preparing for remote audits, as it appears this “new normal” may be something that we all have to adapt to in the future."],"publicationDate":"2020-01-01","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","source":["Level 3"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"doi_dedup___::f98d44bfc157426a38b1a41e2b272684","originalId":["10.21427/yj8x-cm05","oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:level3-1148","3119018542"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/yj8x-cm05"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"3119018542"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:16:57.152","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":2.3516435E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"covid-19","label":"Corona Virus Disease","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.9"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"},{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/yj8x-cm05"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY NC SA","type":"Other literature type","url":["https://dx.doi.org/10.21427/yj8x-cm05"],"publicationDate":"2020-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::9e3be59865b2c1c335d32dae2fe7b254","value":"Datacite"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/yj8x-cm05"}],"license":"CC BY NC SA","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/level3/vol15/iss2/10"],"publicationDate":"2020-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"3119018542"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.21427/yj8x-cm05"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Other literature type","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1148&context=level3","https://arrow.tudublin.ie/level3/vol15/iss2/10/"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

People with dementia tend to find it difficult to recognize, articulate, and express their emotions. This can have a damaging effect on their mental health and the quality of their social relationships. With global populations increasingly aging, the need to address these issues becomes more prominent. One potential aid in tackling such problems is the use of sensor technologies and machine learning algorithms to make face-to-state analysis and classification of emotion status so as to provide care support. This paper describes the SenseCare system that uses affective computing methodology to capture, analyze, and store information on emotional outputs in the aim of providing effective tools for caregivers and medical professionals to provide more holistic care to people with dementia."],"publicationDate":"2018-12-01","publisher":"IEEE","source":["Crossref","2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)"],"format":[],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"container":{"name":"2018 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM)","issnPrinted":null,"issnOnline":null,"issnLinking":null,"ep":null,"iss":null,"sp":null,"vol":null,"edition":null,"conferencePlace":null,"conferenceDate":null},"id":"doi_dedup___::fb74449792bb4ae7cd6889cd5c79b096","originalId":["10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250","690862_675524_PUBLI","2912500208"],"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"},{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2912500208"}],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:32.098","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720173410144,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":4.0,"influence":3.475154E-9,"popularity":1.9998552E-9,"impulse":4.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"projects":[{"id":"corda__h2020::e11e6bc15f98714bc339786ca20fa644","code":"690862","acronym":"SenseCare","title":"Sensor Enabled Affective Computing for Enhancing Medical Care","funder":{"shortName":"EC","name":"European Commission","jurisdiction":"EU","fundingStream":"H2020"},"provenance":{"provenance":"Harvested","trust":"0.900"},"validated":{"validationDate":"2020-09-10","validatedByFunder":true}}],"context":[{"code":"knowmad","label":"Knowmad Institut","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"openaire____::a8db6f6b2ce4fe72e8b2314a9a93e7d9","value":"Sygma"},{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"},{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"},{"key":"re3data_____::c4b2081b224be6b3e79d0e5e5556f631","value":"European Union Open Data Portal"}],"instance":[{"pid":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://doi.org/10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"],"publicationDate":"2018-12-01","refereed":"peerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::081b82f96300b6a6e3d282bad31cb6e2","value":"Crossref"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"}],"type":"Conference object","url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::a8db6f6b2ce4fe72e8b2314a9a93e7d9","value":"Sygma"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"}],"type":"Conference object","url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"],"publicationDate":"2018-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"re3data_____::c4b2081b224be6b3e79d0e5e5556f631","value":"European Union Open Data Portal"}},{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"}],"type":"Other literature type","url":["http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"],"publicationDate":"2018-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"re3data_____::c4b2081b224be6b3e79d0e5e5556f631","value":"European Union Open Data Portal"}},{"pid":[{"scheme":"mag_id","value":"2912500208"},{"scheme":"doi","value":"10.1109/bibm.2018.8621250"}],"alternateIdentifier":[],"type":"Article","url":["https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/sensecare-using-automatic-emotional-analysis-to-provide-effective","https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/bibm/bibm2018.html#DonovanHZEVFWHK18","https://ulster-staging.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/sensecare-using-automatic-emotional-analysis-to-provide-effective"],"refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"openaire____::55045bd2a65019fd8e6741a755395c8c","value":"Unknown Repository"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"openaire____::5f532a3fc4f1ea403f37070f59a7a53a","value":"Microsoft Academic Graph"}}],"isGreen":false,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

Context in this sense is defined as the user's location in virtual space and the particular mobile device being modeled together with user preferences or profile. The purpose is to automatically push relevant data from the database server to the client based on this comprehensive definition of the user's context. Consideration in regard to which mobile device is currently being modeled is a primary filter for determining what data will be sent and in what format. For example, image data will not be sent to a mobile phone and video will not be sent to a PDA.

While UOIT has a well-developed set of pathways from Ontario colleges, UOIT has only recently joined other Ontario universities in creating ‘2+2'–style pathway or articulation agreements with international institutions. The models for these agreements are numerous (2+2, 3+1+1, etc.), with any number of possible permutations. The rationales for these arrangements are also numerous, and vary based on type and direction of the arrangement, the context of the home institution and home country, and the priorities of the receiving Ontario university, amongst other factors. This paper explores those rationales and analyzes them within the context of the broader internationalization of higher education, with a particular focus on the possibility of college-to- university transfer pathways across borders. This paper will situate the development of international college-to-university transfer pathways within both the literature on international education and the literature on post-secondary transferability, identify key unresolved issues for understanding these specific types of international pathways, and further explore the possible benefits of this “niche” pathway approach for UOIT’s burgeoning internationalization efforts."],"publicationDate":"2016-01-01","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","source":["Credit Transfer and Recognition"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"od______1248::2f73b48dbc4084a4fb7a7cd3484346b3","originalId":["oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:heit163-1000"],"pid":[],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:12:58.836","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720091548080,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":1.3486456E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}],"instance":[{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Conference object","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/context/heit163/article/1000/viewcontent/Opening_International_Pathways_an_analysis_of_internationalization_rationales.pdf"],"publicationDate":"2016-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

This thesis outlines the problems that may be faced by the electricity system and illustrates the benefits that large scale energy storage can bring to the electricity system when trying to integrate large amounts of wind energy. Energy storage is currently a topical subject in Ireland as wind penetration increases and problems such as curtailment loom. This thesis outlines the storage capacities required to sufficiently aid the integration of wind energy in Ireland and outlines the value that large scale energy storage can bring to the Irish electricity system. Models of the system load and wind generation profile are devised and wind penetration scenarios representing 13%, 20%, 40% and 60% wind penetration are developed. These wind penetration scenarios are analysed and the curtailment levels associated with them are calculated. Storage is then introduced to the system models and these are analysed. The improvements in system operation are outlined and the reduction in curtailment and required conventional generation are calculated. Popular generation adequacy assessment techniques are investigated and a generation adequacy assessment is carried out on the system models. Finally the value introduced to the system by adding the energy storage system is quantified by estimating the amount of conventional generation that has been offset by its introduction. The analysis shows that energy storage adds little or no value to the Irish electricity system when penetration levels of wind generation are under 20%. At penetration levels of 40% and 60%, energy storage significantly increases the amount of wind energy that is absorbed by the system and reduces the levels of curtailment and required conventional generation."],"publicationDate":"2010-10-01","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","source":["ME in Sustainable Electrical Energy Systems"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":["Dr. Michael Conlon"],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"od______1248::48e47099f4b11cabae6039d21aea24a5","originalId":["oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:engscheledismese-1001"],"pid":[],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:12:30.471","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720091562210,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":6.5821576E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}],"instance":[{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Doctoral thesis","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/engscheledismese/1"],"publicationDate":"2010-10-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

St. Mary’s closed in 1964 and lay derelict for a number of years until it was purchased by John Keating in 1997. Following extensive restoration over a seven year period, this List 1 building finally re-opened its doors in December 2005 as John M. Keating’s Bar. The tasteful conversion and refurbishment of this Dublin landmark was acknowledged at the Dublin City Neighbourhood Awards 2006, where it won first prize in the category of Best Old Building In September 2007 the building was acquired by new owners and renamed “The Church Bar & Restaurant” and its range of services was expanded to include a Café, Night Club and a Barbeque area on the terrace. The minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has classified the building as one of intrinsical historical interest.

I read most of Macken’s novels as a teenager and enjoyed them enormously. It is a shame that there is little or no critical attention now paid to someone who had such a successful career as a novelist, playwright, actor and director. Even the publication by his son Ultan of a biography, Walter Macken: Dreams on Paper, by Mercier Press in 2009, has not inspired scholars to engage with his work in a serious manner. Perhaps the archive of An Taidhbhearc theatre at the James Hardiman Library in NUI Galway may draw attention to the seminal work he carried out at this important artistic venue."],"publicationDate":"2013-08-20","publisher":"Technological University Dublin","source":["Articles"],"format":["application/pdf"],"contributor":[],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"od______1248::881ebccc125ef2b8b756f57cf00d6625","originalId":["oai:arrow.tudublin.ie:ittbus-1061"],"pid":[],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:12:59.733","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720091595591,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":9.2213404E-10,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]},{"code":"eut","label":"EUt+","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.85"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}],"instance":[{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Article","url":["https://arrow.tudublin.ie/context/ittbus/article/1061/viewcontent/irishtimes.com___Revisiting_Walter_Macken_s_Connemara___Tue_Aug_20_01_00_00_IST_2013.pdf"],"publicationDate":"2013-08-20","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::39e4973ba3321b80f37d9b55f63ed8b8","value":"Arrow@TU Dublin"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}

The proprietor is Elaine Murphy. The Winding Stair started life as a bookshop and café which was a popular meeting spot in Dublin during the 1970s and 1980s. The café closed in 2005 and in 2006 the current proprietor re-opened it as a restaurant. “The bookshop, located on the ground floor, was retained as were many of the old bookshelves, photos and memories. The room retains its timeless charm with stripped wood tables and floors, and Bentwood café chairs. The old girders give a nod to its past as a tweed loom and the view remains as quintessentially Dublin as ever. The food is good, old-fashioned home cooking with produce sourced from artisans within the island. The beer list focuses on local and international micro-breweries with an emphasis on good, food matched beers and ales.

In addition, there is a great 14 variety of pathologies associated with this versatile Gram-negative bacterium. 15 P. aeruginosa cells are able to produce an incredible arsenal of virulence factors, 16 especially secreted molecules that act singly or together to ensure the 17 establishment, maintenance, and persistence of a successful infection in 18 susceptible hosts. In this context, pseudomonal proteases roles are highlighted 19 due to their ability to cleave key host proteinaceous substrates as well as to 20 modulate several biological processes, for example, escaping and modulating the 21 host immune responses in the bacterial own favor. Proteases secreted by 22 P. aeruginosa include elastase A (LasA), elastase B (LasB), alkaline protease 23 (AP), protease IV (PIV), Pseudomonas small protease (PASP), large protease A 24 (LepA), MucD, and P. aeruginosa aminopeptidase (PAAP).

Instructions are a method to communicate how to perform a procedure for different reasons and pedagogical goals. This can range from assistance with once-off product assembly to long term learning. The main barrier to mass adoption of optical see-through AR headsets for these roles arises when AR instruction fails to fulfil the user’s pragmatic and hedonic needs and expectations due to human, system and context influencing factors. User quality of experience (QoE) considers this fulfilment to be reflected in the user’s degree of delight or annoyance. The ability to directly measure emotional response using modern psychophysiological instruments is shifting the focus of quality assessment towards evaluation of fulfilment of user needs and expectations. In this context, the work presented in this thesis focuses on understanding the influence of instruction formats considering AR as a potential platform for procedure assistance and training. Instruction format was evaluated over two distinct studies specific to the procedure assistance and training roles. In Study 1, the influence of paper-based and AR-based text instruction formats on user QoE for procedure assistance was evaluated using a Rubik’s Cube® proof of concept. In Study 2, a combined text and interactive animated 3D model instruction format was compared against a text-only instruction format within AR using a GoCube™ proof of concept for training. Two separate AR applications were developed. Physiological ratings, facial expressions and eye gaze metrics were recorded. Subjective experience was reported using Likert scale, self-assessment manikin and NASA task load questionnaires. Statistical analysis was employed to identify statistically significant differences between usage of the different instruction formats. Correlation and regression analysis were undertaken to identify novel implicit metrics of QoE. The results from Study 1 show that the AR instruction format yielded objective performance benefits over the paper-based instruction format for procedure assistance while participants reported higher acceptability of AR. Heart rate features indicated increasing stress in both test groups, which corelated to mental load in both groups. Study 2 results show that the text-only instruction format yielded faster instruction response times in procedure training compared to a combined text and model instruction format. Female trainees using the combined instruction format were significantly slower in training and recall than females that used the text-only instruction format but reported requiring less cognitive effort than male participants during training and recall. An absence of statistically significant correlations between physiological ratings, facial expression and emotion terms used by the participants, calls into question the utility of such emotion terms as measures of emotional state. Facial expressions of action unit 20 correlated to task duration in both studies. yes"],"publicationDate":"2023-01-01","publisher":"Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest","source":[],"format":["PDF","application/pdf"],"contributor":["Murray, Niall","Flynn, Ronan","Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest"],"coverage":[],"bestAccessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/"},"id":"od______9692::64ee138dc7f959389df44d9b13f1a155","originalId":["oai:research.thea.ie:20.500.12065/4673"],"pid":[],"dateOfCollection":"2024-07-05T19:17:39.506","lastUpdateTimeStamp":1720091315972,"indicators":{"citationImpact":{"citationCount":0.0,"influence":2.9837197E-9,"popularity":3.6588395E-9,"impulse":0.0,"citationClass":"C5","influenceClass":"C5","impulseClass":"C5","popularityClass":"C5"}},"context":[{"code":"tunet","label":"TU-NET","provenance":[{"provenance":"Inferred by OpenAIRE","trust":"0.8"}]}],"collectedFrom":[{"key":"opendoar____::f044bd02e4fe1aa3315ace7645f8597a","value":"Research@THEA"}],"instance":[{"pid":[],"alternateIdentifier":[],"license":"CC BY NC SA","accessRight":{"code":"c_abf2","label":"OPEN","scheme":"http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/access_rights/","openAccessRoute":null},"type":"Doctoral thesis","url":["https://research.thea.ie/handle/20.500.12065/4673"],"publicationDate":"2023-01-01","refereed":"nonPeerReviewed","hostedBy":{"key":"opendoar____::f044bd02e4fe1aa3315ace7645f8597a","value":"Research@THEA"},"collectedFrom":{"key":"opendoar____::f044bd02e4fe1aa3315ace7645f8597a","value":"Research@THEA"}}],"isGreen":true,"isInDiamondJournal":false}
